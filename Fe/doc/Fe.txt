Fitting steps to determine the exchange constants for Fe:
-total energies for non-magnetic, ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic(checkerboard) and
 anti-ferromagnetic(striped) calculated from Quantum Espresso(QE).

-corresponding first and second nearest neighbor energies calculated for the different 
 cases using bcc_mg.cpp. The different configurations are as shown in the figures 
 nm.png, ferromagnetic.png, afm_striped.png and afm_checkerboard.png. 

-fit is done using jconst_fit.py and resulting values used in heisenberg.cpp for the 
 simulation.

Energies from QE:

 NM   1     -54.94490706 Ry
 FM   1     -55.12807369 Ry
 AFM1 2    -110.49690675 Ry
 AFM2 4    -220.84368080 Ry

1st and 2nd nearest neighbor interactions:

 MG    		Sj1 	Sj2 
 NM    		0	0
 FM    		8	6
 AFM_1 		-8	6
 AFM_2 		0	-6

Exchange constants from least squares fit in Ry:

J_1 = 7.52373031e-03, J_2 = 2.55273958e-03

Resulting curves for Magnetization and energy are shown in the plots for N=250 and 
N=1024.

The critical temperature, Tc, comes at around 1000K, compared to the experimental 1043K 
for Fe.
